    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        With a relentless hunger for how things work, my curiosity has led me to the field of engineering.
        I have always been fascinated with how things work. My earliest memories were of me taking apart
        my toys to make Frankenstein versions of them and, more often than not, of me dissembling
        something and then crying afterwards after not remembering how to reassemble them again (RIP DYNEX
        VCR player).
        I believe that my passion for electronics started from a romanticism over robotics. I was so
        fascinated by the visuals of shows like Gundam, Transformers, and other 90s anime, from there I
        knew that I wanted to be at the fore front of innovation of technology. Once attending university,
        I changed my major. I was initally Biomedical Engineering because I thought I would be able to
        build prosthetics; however, I soon realized that I am just more interested in the assembly and
        power aspect of things so I changed my major to electrical engineering and have been happy ever
        since.

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        My expectations for this class are pretty substantial. I feel like I'm the only non-experienced
        coder in this class. It feels like everyone in the class is either CS, CE, or ITM. As a result, I
        hope to get from this class is a new love for coding. I have taken some coding classes like Java
        and 68k, but I learned them with great difficulty. I hope I become fond of HTML and CSS. More
        importantly, I would like the know how to make a website. I know that there are tons of assist
        websites to make a website however they are pretty limited.

    <h2>Beyond</h2>
      <p>
        After graduation I hope to someday work for a high-tech company that specializes in PCBs for
        laptops or cellphones. I would like to work at Exelon or ComEd. However, I would also be
        interested in Motorola have visited their HQ during a high school field trip. I've done well
        in my basic circuit analysis classes, so I feel confident pursuing a job in the field that
        requires my basic circuit analysis skills. So far, I still haven't taken the last of my ECE
        classes so I'll find out soon what I prefer doing for the time to come.
