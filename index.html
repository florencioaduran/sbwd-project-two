      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Florencio A. Duran and I am currently an undergraduate student at IIT in
        Electrical Engineering. My hope is to someday go into power electronics at a high tech
        company where I can apply what I've learned from circuit analysis, electrodynamics, and
        signals and systems.

        I will be graduating from IIT in December of 2019 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I
        received an A.S. in Science from Harold Washington College in December of 2016. My interests
        span multiple interdisciplinary interests from robotics, circuits, design, autonomy, AI,
        digital electronics, controls, and music.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Besides working on my class work, I enjoy making security cameras for my family's house.
          The security cameras that I've built have changed from iteration to iteration; however,
          everytime I build a new camera, I learn something new about programing and visual
          processing. Furthermore, I learn how to make them more cost effective and tailored for
          each project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first two photos are of the first camerea I've ever built and it lets my family see
          when packages arrive at the door. The third photo is of my second camera which had higher
          quality streaming and was water proof but was too difficult to modify into night vision.
          The last image is of my most recent camera which is can see at night and is water proof.
          The case was 3D printed using tinkercad!
