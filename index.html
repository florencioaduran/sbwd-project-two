        Hello! My name is Florencio A. Duran and I am currently an undergraduate student at IIT in
        Electrical Engineering. My hope is to someday go into power electronics at a high tech
        company where I can apply what I've learned from circuit analysis, electrodynamics, and
        signals and systems.

        I will be graduating from IIT in December of 2019 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I
        received an A.S. in Science from Harold Washington College in December of 2016. My interests
        span multiple interdisciplinary interests from robotics, circuits, design, autonomy, AI,
        digital electronics, controls, and music.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Besides working on my class work, I enjoy making security cameras for my family's house.
          The security cameras that I've built have changed from iteration to iteration; however,
          everytime I build a new camera, I learn something new about programing and visual
          processing. Furthermore, I learn how to make them more cost effective and tailored for
          each project.
