Hello! My name is Florencio A. Duran and I am currently an undergraduate student at IIT in
Electrical Engineering. My hope is to someday go into power electronics at a high tech
company where I can apply what I've learned from circuit analysis, electrodynamics, and
signals and systems.

I will be graduating from IIT in December of 2019 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I
received an A.S. in Science from Harold Washington College in December of 2016. My interests
span multiple interdisciplinary interests from robotics, circuits, design, autonomy, AI,
digital electronics, controls, and music.

Besides working on my class work, I enjoy making security cameras for my family's house. The
security cameras that I've built have changed from iteration to iteration; however,
everytime I build a new camera, I learn something new about programing and visual
processing. Furthermore, I learn how to make them more cost effective and tailored for each
project.
